Model Evaluation

Classification of bird sound can be applicable in the field of wildfire conservation, habitat assessment, among other things and so our model evaluation of this is crucial. This section of the proposal outlines the plan for evaluating the performance of a machine learning model trained for bird sound classification.

To ensure the effectiveness in classifying the different bird sounds, the evaluation will assess the model's;
*Accuracy: This is known as percentage classifies the bird sound samples correctly
* Recall: This shows the true positives predictions out in all the actual positives
* Precision: This shows the true positive predictions out of all positive predictions. 
* Confusion Matrix: It represents the counts of true positive, true negative, false positive, and false negative predictions
* F1 score: It is the harmonic mean of precision and recall, providing a balanced measure of the model's performance
* ROC Curve: this is a plot that shows the performance of the model across different thresholds.
* AUC-ROC: This is the metric that quantifies the overall performance of the model across various threshold.

The evaluation process will include the following:
* Data Preprocessing: Techniques such as noise reduction and normalization will be applied to the raw the data. The dataset will be preprocessed to extract relevant features such as spectrograms, doing Fourier Transform, Mel-frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCCs), or other domain-specific features that are useful for bird sound classification.
* Model Training: Machine learning classifiers, like KNN, Random Forest, SVM, CNN and RNN will be trained using the preprocessed dataset.
* Cross-Validation: Trained model will undergo cross-validation to assess its performance across different subsets of the dataset. Stratified k-fold cross-validation will be employed to ensure balanced distribution of classes.
* Evaluation Metrics Calculation: As mentioned earlier, the model's performance will be evaluated using the evaluation metrics 
* Environmental Variability Analysis: The model will be tested on recordings captured under various environmental conditions, such as different times of the day, weather conditions, and levels of background noise, to evaluate its robustness.
* Model Interpretability: Techniques such as class activation maps or feature importance analysis will be used to interpret the model's decision-making process and identify important features contributing to classification.
* Comparison with Baseline Models: The performance of the developed model will be compared with baseline

Conclusion
By employing this different evaluation metrics and analysis techniques, we aim to provide insights into the model's accuracy, reliability, and potential areas for improvement
