**Project Proposal: Bird Sound Classification using Machine Learning**

## Motivation

Birds play a critical role in maintaining ecological balance, and their presence or absence can be an indicator of the health of an ecosystem. 
Traditional methods of monitoring bird populations, such as field surveys, are time-consuming and require significant human effort. 
With advancements in machine learning and audio processing, there is an opportunity to automate bird sound classification, 
which can aid in efficient biodiversity monitoring, conservation efforts, and habitat assessment.

## Objective
The objective of this project is to develop a machine learning model that can accurately classify bird sounds into their respective species. 
This will involve preprocessing audio data, selecting relevant features, 
and evaluating various machine learning classifiers to determine the most effective approach for classification.

## Dataset

The dataset for this project will be sourced from Kaggle and consists of approximately 1000 .wav files for each of the 5 bird species. 
The audio files will undergo preprocessing techniques such as noise reduction and normalization 
to ensure quality input for the classification models.

## Methodology

### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Preprocessing: Apply noise reduction and normalization to the raw audio data.

Visualization: Use waveform plots, spectrograms, and Fourier transforms to analyze the temporal characteristics of the sounds.

Dimensionality Reduction: Employ PCA, t-SNE, and UMAP to identify patterns and clusters in the data.

### Feature Selection/Extraction
Utilize methods like RFE and Random Forest feature importance for feature selection.

Apply PCA, t-SNE, and UMAP for feature extraction to handle the high complexity of the data.

### Machine Learning Classifiers
Baseline Model: Use logistic regression as a benchmark for performance comparison.

KNN: Evaluate different values of k to prevent underfitting and overfitting.

Random Forest: Explore this interpretable classifier for its robustness.

SVM: Apply SVM with kernel techniques to handle non-linear data.

XGBoost: Utilize regularization techniques to prevent overfitting.

CNN and RNN: Investigate deep learning models for their effectiveness in audio classification.

### Intended Experiments
The effectiveness of the classifiers will be compared based on evaluation metrics such as accuracy, recall, precision, F1 score, ROC curve, and AUC-ROC. 

The experiments will involve individual assessment of classifiers as well as their combinations with different feature selection/extraction methods to determine an optimal pipeline for classification.

### Model Evaluation
The performance of the machine learning model will be evaluated using the following metrics:

Accuracy: Percentage of correctly classified samples.

Recall: True positive rate.

Precision: Positive predictive value.

Confusion Matrix: Visual representation of the classifier's performance.

F1 Score: Harmonic mean of precision and recall.

ROC Curve and AUC-ROC: Assessing the model's ability to distinguish between classes.

The evaluation will include cross-validation and environmental variability analysis to ensure the robustness of the model across different conditions.

## Conclusion
By developing an effective machine learning model for bird sound classification, 
this project aims to contribute to wildlife conservation, habitat assessment, and biodiversity monitoring. 
The findings from this study can provide insights into the ecological dynamics of bird populations and inform conservation strategies.
